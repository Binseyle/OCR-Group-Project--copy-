First you need SDL Library On your computeur and a Gcc compiler.
Makefiles are here to make the compilation easier.
To use the program go to the 'Interface' folder and type 'Make' and type './interface' 
To tryout how the neural network deals with images you should go to the .hidden file (our team is ashamed by not being able to finnish at time :( )
In the .hidden file type make , and then type './train training/X/0.gif'

THE X can be replaced by any letter lower or upper case (we have different images of letters with links to the actual letters)

The output will be shown on the console.
